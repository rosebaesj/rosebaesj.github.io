## About me

I'm **Chanwoo Park** , a student at Seoul National University. I major in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science(Triple major). 

More specifically, my research topic is mainly in the area of optimization and nonparametric inference, and applying to biological data. I have accumulated my own research experience in Generalized Structural Component Analysis (GSCA), Polygenic Score Matching (PSM), and Optimized Gradient Methods (OGM). I'm interested in theoritical statitstics, biostatistics, and machine learning theory(especially optimization). I have a solid backgrounds on mathematics and statistics. 

I was a researcher in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Lab ([BIBS](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/)) at SNU, directed by Prof. Taesung Park. Under the guidance of Taesung Park, I wrote one paper, "Pure additive contribution of genetic variants to a risk prediction model using propensity score matching: application to type 2 diabetes"

Currently, I'm a researcher in Ryu's Optimization Group ([Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/)) at SNU, directed by Ernest K. Ryu. I'm really excited when I study optimization theory. 

I'm also Korea Actuary since 2018. 

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, R, C++, and Java, and I usually utilize them for research. As a hobby, I used to play the electronic guitar, and running through Gwanak Mountain.
